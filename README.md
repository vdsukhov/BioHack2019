It is a biohack project. We present a possible orange gene ELF4 for domestic cat and also description of our research.

Firstly we define the orange locus definded in the https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666509/ by using the FCA-markers. Then we annotated it and find 3 suspicious genes, namely BTF3, ELF4 and ZNF280 (and SH2D1A).
